This is a repository designed to fine tune an AI model on St. Ignatius' teachings.

## Introduction
This project seeks to customize an AI model for educational use, centering on St. Ignatius's teachings. The model will function locally and provide accurate responses tailored to educational settings.

## Objectives
The goals and objectives for the project include:
- Create a fully operational AI model
- Train the model on St. Ignatius' teachings
- Model will assist students and teachers in creating educational materials
- Model will provide personalized learning

## Proposed System
1. Model Selection: Source the Llama 2.3 Lightweight 3B model on Kaggle platform.

2. Fine-Tuning: Utilize Kaggle’s computing resources to fine-tune the Llama 3B Instruct model with a curated dataset focused on St. Ignatius's teachings. This process will shape the model’s ability to generate educational materials, quizzes, and summaries that support teaching goals.

3. Conversion: After fine-tuning, convert the model to the GPT-3 Unified Format (GFUF) to standardize it for integration into various platforms.

4. Local Deployment: Deploy the converted model in Jan.AI, a local environment designed to run entirely offline. The setup will undergo thorough testing to verify its ability to produce relevant educational content independently of internet access.
